flecks of colour.
swirls of colour.
fizzing bubbles.
bubbles suspended in it.
some kind of bone floating in it.
leaves and flowers in it.
two separated liquid phases.
a bright glow.
a soft glow.
stripes of colour.
translucency.
a cloudy murkiness.
blood within it.
dirt floating in it.
chunks of metal in it.
some type of gore from a slain creature.
steam coming from it.
a face in the liquid.
constantly moving and shifting liquid.
a constant heat.
