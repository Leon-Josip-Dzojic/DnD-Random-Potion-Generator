# DnD-Random-Potion-Generator
Generates a list of potions for D&amp;D 5e randomly using community-made list of properties and characteristics.

My thanks go to the Reddit user /olirant from /r/DnDBehindTheScreen for coming up with most of the original tables.
The Potency, Quality and Duration tables are my own addition.
Additionally, all the numeric (dice) values are merely there to assis the DM and not set in stone.
Some extra advice:
The dice associated with quality determinate the MAXIMAL damage the side effect can inflict upon you if it deals damage.
This is only meant as a guide to the DM, the actual value always remains with the DM to decide.
The greater the potency the greater the damage if the quality is low.
For example a supreme potency, crude potion would probably do the most damage if it has a damaging side effect.
The logic being that using powerful ingredients causes powerful reactions be they desired or not. Also you will note that the 
damage for the worst quality is not as large as the potential healing with best potency and a healing effect. This stems from the general rule
that effects which are undesired can rarely match the potency desired effects can achieve after a lot of refinement.
(A defective bomb can hardly do more damage than a properly functioning one.
